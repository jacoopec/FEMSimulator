1D Beam 2 (displacement + rotation)	Adds bending stiffness
K, representing the global stiffness matrix in the FEM equation:
the overall FEM structure remains:
[𝐾]{𝑢}={𝐹}

K: The name of the matrix — it holds stiffness coefficients between all pairs of nodes.

In FEM, we build a global stiffness matrix that combines the contributions of each element. 
It tells us how displacement at one node affects forces at all nodes.

How you compute local K_e
How many DOFs per node you handle
The shape of your global K
